# letsbuildazooutility
This is a utility project for the game Let's Build a Zoo!  It allows users to track their animals (name, age, location, breed, and variant), their breeding pairs, and the hybrids they've already created.

This project uses UserSpice because why invent the wheel.  Users are able to do as much or as little with it as they choose.

This project contains the following tools:
-  Animal tracker:
   -  Species
   -  Variant
   -  Name
   -  Location
 Animals can be filtered by species or location.  I plan to add other filter/search options in the future.

-  Breeding Pairs
   -  Species
   -  Location
   -  Parent 1 variant
   -  Parent 1 name
   -  Parent 1 age
   -  Parent 2 variant
   -  Parent 2 name
   -  Parent 2 age
Pairs can be filtered by species or location.  I also plan to add a way to view all possible pairs and which variants they would produce, which would tie in with the Animals tracker.

-  Hybrids
   -  Parent one species
   -  Parent two species
   -  Hybrid species name
   -  Animal name
Currently, the location isn't tracked.  I might add that in the future.
